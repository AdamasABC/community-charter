# ABC Community-Charter

## Part 1: Who we are
The ABC Club at Adamas University aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application. We focus on creating a vibrant community of students, faculty, and industry experts to foster skill development in emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, and full-stack development.

## Part 2: Mission and Vision
- **Mission**: To provide students with hands-on experience and industry insights while fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Our primary goal is to give students real-world experience by integrating three core aspects:
- **Business Perspective**
- **IT Metrics**
- **Finance Numbers**

Imagine this as a Venn diagram where these three domains overlap. At the center is the real-world experience—achieved through balancing technical know-how, business acumen, and financial insights. Our goal is to make students industry-ready by creating this cross-section in every project and activity we undertake.

We emphasize the "Why" behind our initiatives:

This approach ensures that students grasp the reasoning behind technical decisions, preparing them for real-world scenarios.
